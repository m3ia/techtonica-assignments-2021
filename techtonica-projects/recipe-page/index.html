    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p class="bg"><i>"Kulfi, the Indian version of ice cream that may go back to the 16th century, is made without stirring
        from milk boiled down to a fraction of its original volume, and therefore concentrated in texture-smoothing
        milk proteins and sugar. It has a strong cooked-milk, butterscotch flavor." </i> <br>
      - <b>On Food and Cooking: The
        Science and Lore of the Kitchen</b>, by Harold McGee<br><br>
      I first had kesar pista kulfi, it was while meeting my boyfriend's family for the first time.
      It was a divine creamy, and fragrant dessert. <br>
      One day, I was so inspired that I decided to buy
      an ice cream maker to make it for special occasions.

          over medium heat on the stove. Stirring until well combined and heated but not bubbling. Remove from heat and

        <li>Gently warm the outside of the molds (bowls or pan) with warm water and using thin spatula or knife run it
          around the edges to loosen ( or to cut squares if in a pan) and invert servings on to a plate or bowl.
          Sprinkle some of the pistachios and a small bit of the ground cardamom over each serving. <b>Serve and
            enjoy!</b></li>
